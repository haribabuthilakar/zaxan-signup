            <h4>What is this Zaxan thing?</h4>
            <h6>Zaxan is an awesomely friendly application that helps friends split bills and keep track of what they owe each other after outings, movies, parties and beer sessions. It can also be used by roommates to keep track of their regular expenses.</h6>

            <h4>How does it work?</h4>
            <h6>Extremely elegantly. With as few clicks or typing as possible. Add your activity with location and date, select your friends, enter the amounts, and keep track.</h6>
 
            <h4>Aren’t there other apps out there?</h4>
            <h6>Yes, plenty. With lots more features. They’ll help you scan bills, calculate tips, manage budgets, settle expenses online, and do your laundry. But sometimes, the only thing people want to do is to keep track of expenses and be reminded of what they need to do. That’s all Zaxan does, with minimum fuss.</h6>
             
            <h4>Can I pay my friends through this app?</h4>
            <h6>Not yet. We are honest and hard-working people, but we find it hard to get near other people’s money without sneakily stuffing some of it into our pockets. We’d rather stay clear of it for now.</h6>
             
            <h4>How do you make money?</h4>
            <h6>We don’t, yet. Someday, we will. Hope springs eternal.</h6>
             
            <h4>So how do you manage your costs?</h4>
            <h6>Employees. They are our most valuable resource. We not only don’t pay them any salaries, we also force them to part with their savings to pay for our hosting, infrastructure and marketing. Basically, we screw our employees. We are not very different from large corporates that way.</h6>
             
            <h4>But seriously, you must have some kind of business plan?</h4>
            <h6>It is kind of vague as of now. If we overcome our propensity to steal others’ money, we might enable online payments and levy a small transaction charge over and above the astronomical amounts that payment gateways charge. Or we’ll try and push ads to you, with as little annoyance as possible. Or catch hold of some gullible venture capitalist with money to burn. Preferably one who has a severe case of amnesia.</h6>
             
            <h4>What’s with the name?</h4>
            <h6>Zaxan is the ancient mythological goddess of accounting, harvest and cattle grazing. She is the daughter of Zygya and Un, and sister of Ukeya, the goddess of friendship and love. She is depicted with long flowing hair and carries a trident. She keeps record of transactions between gods, and uses her trident to strike down those who accumulate huge debts they have no intention of repaying. But she is largely depicted as warm and friendly, probably under the influence of her exceedingly charming sister. Like most gods and goddesses, she was invented by humans, specifically the developers of Zaxan.</h6>
             
            <h4>How do I get in touch with you?</h4>
            <h6>Feel free to drop is a note at <a href="mailto:info@zaxan.com">info@zaxan.com</a>. We'll love to hear from you</h6>
          </div>
          <div class="tab-pane" id="stuff">
            <h4>What information do we collect?</h4>
            <h6>Anything that you enter on the left, plus your visit details via Google Analytics</h6>
            
            <h4>What do we do with it?</h4>
            <h6>We'll send exactly one email to you once we are ready to on onboard users. In addition, if you have marked yourself as 'open to be contacted for product interviews', we may reach out to you via email for talking about it.</h6>
            
            <h4>Security</h4>
            <h6>All this information is stored on Amazon AWS infrastructure and MongoHQ. Both providers maintain the highest level of securiity available in commercial hosting</h6>
            
            <h4>Cookies</h4>
            <h6>We don't store cookies. We link to Twitter and Facebook, though, and they set their own cookies, governed by their own policies. We also use Google Analytics, which sets its own cookie.</h6>
